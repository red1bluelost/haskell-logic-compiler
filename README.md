## How to Run
You will need [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) installed (you don't need GHC, Stack will install a local compiler regardless). Stack is a build manager tool for Haskell which I used for this project.

Open the base code directory and use `stack run` to run the main file or `stack test` to run the tests. The first time you run this it will take a while to install and build the compiler and libraries that I used.

The actual write up for the challenge is located in "src/Main.hs".
